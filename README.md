## 📌 Project Overview

The **SmartCart Clustering System** is an **Unsupervised Machine Learning project** that analyzes customer data and groups customers into different segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.

Customer segmentation helps businesses:

- Understand different customer types
- Improve marketing strategies
- Target the right audience
- Increase customer satisfaction and sales

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to automatically identify meaningful customer groups.

## 🤖 Clustering Algorithm

The system uses **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups customers based on similarity.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Select number of clusters (**K**)  
2. Assign customers to the nearest cluster center  
3. Update cluster centroids  
4. Repeat until clusters stabilize  

This helps discover **hidden patterns in customer behavior**.

---

## 📊 Features Used

The model uses the following attributes:

- Age  
- Income  
- Education  
- Marital Status  
- Total Spending  
- Customer Tenure  
- Number of Children  

These features allow the algorithm to group customers with **similar demographic and spending patterns**.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project (Using VS Code)

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saifullah857/Smartcart-Clustering-System.git
```

### 2️⃣ Open Project in VS Code

```bash
cd Smartcart-Clustering-System
code .
```

### 3️⃣ Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Notebook

Open the **Jupyter Notebook file in VS Code** and run all cells.

---

## 📈 Visualization

The project visualizes clusters using:

- Scatter plots
- Customer distribution graphs
- Spending pattern analysis

These visualizations help interpret **customer segmentation results**.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Add **DBSCAN Clustering**
- Build an **interactive Streamlit Dashboard**
- Create a **Customer Recommendation System**
- Deploy the project online
